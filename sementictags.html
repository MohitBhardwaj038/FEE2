                    Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli] ⓘ; (born 5 November 1988) is an Indian
                    international cricketer who currently plays Test cricket and ODI cricket for India. Kohli is a
                    former T20I player and a former captain of the Indian national cricket team. He is a <mark>right-handed
                    batsman and an occasional unorthodox right arm quick bowler.</mark> He currently represents Royal
                    Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. He holds the record as the highest
                    run-scorer in IPL, ranks third in T20I, third in ODI, and stands as the fourth-highest in
                    international cricket.[4] He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and
                    stands second in the list of most international centuries scored. Hence, Kohli is widely regarded as
                    one of the <mark>greatest batsmen of all time</mark> and the modern era. Kohli was a key member of the Indian
                    team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 Champions Trophy and 2024 T20 World Cup and captained
                    India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in 2017, 2018, and 2019.[5]
                </section><br>
                <section>In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen. In 2015, he achieved
                    the summit of T20I rankings.[6] <mark>In 2018, he was ranked top Test batsman, making him the only Indian
                    cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game.</mark> He is the first player to
                    score 20,000 runs in a decade. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male
                    cricketer of the decade.[7]

                        Kohli has received many accolades for his performances in cricket. He won the ICC ODI Player of
                        the Year award four times in 2012, 2017, 2018, and 2023. He also won the Sir Garfield Sobers
                        Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of the Year, on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively.
                        In 2018, he became the first player to win both ICC ODI and Test Player of the Year awards in
                        the same year. Also, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three
                        consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. At the national level, Kohli was honoured with the <mark>Arjuna
                        Award in 2013</mark>, the <mark>Padma Shri in 2017</mark>, and India's highest sporting honour, the <mark>Khel Ratna
                        Award, in 2018.</mark> In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential
                        people in the world.

                        After winning the final of the 2024 T20 World Cup, Kohli announced his retirement from T20I.[8]

                <h3>Career</h3><hr>
                <section>Kohli's batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn comparisons to the legendary Sachin Tendulkar, who he regarded as the epitome of excellence in the sport of cricket. Dubbed as Tendulkar's "successor",[19][20] he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records in the future.[21][22] His reverence for Tendulkar as a role model, who he idolized in his formative years and sought to emulate, is well-documented. Kohli has stated that he tried to mirror Tendulkar's style of batting, imitating his shots and attempting to hit sixes in a similar manner.[23] Kohli's aggressive and dynamic style has earned him accolades from cricketing greats such as Vivian Richards, who has acknowledged Kohli's similarities to his own playing style.[24] He has been lauded as the <mark>"king of world cricket"</mark> by Dean Jones, a former Australian cricketer.[25] While Indian commentator Aakash Chopra has noted that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of shots,[26] Kohli's skills with the bat have earned him accolades from former West Indies great Brian Lara, who has ranked him among the best batsmen in the world alongside Joe Root, the England captain at the time.</section><br>
                <section>In a discourse with the prominent Bollywood actor Salman Khan, Tendulkar proclaimed that Kohli possesses the potential to surpass his record of 100 international centuries. Tendulkar also acknowledged Kohli's batting aptitudes and the steadfastness with which he has accumulated runs.[28] In 2013, Tendulkar retired from international cricket, marking the end of an era for Indian cricket. Kohli, who played alongside Tendulkar in the team, honoured him by presenting him with a sacred thread that had been gifted to him by his late father. Tendulkar eventually returned the thread to him, imploring that it should remain in his possession. </section><br>
                
                <section>Kohli's playing style is widely regarded as aggressive, a trait that extends to his leadership on the field. He is well known for his passionate and animated responses to on-field situations, demonstrating a fierce competitiveness.[55][56] His captaincy is characterized as proactive, taking bold decisions and leading the team by example.[57] Kohli has been the subject of much media scrutiny and criticism in the early stages of his career. He was often portrayed as a brash and arrogant individual, eliciting mixed reactions from fans, critics and former cricketers alike.[58][59] While some have praised his assertiveness and confidence,[60][61] others have criticized Kohli's behaviour for crossing the boundaries of fair play and for losing control, sometimes resulting in a loss of composure.[62] Despite his efforts to curb his aggressive behaviour, Kohli has acknowledged that there are times when intense pressure or high-stakes situations may challenge his resolve. Nevertheless, the cricketer has persistently maintained that his aggression acts as a source of inspiration and drives his focus and motivation on the field.[63] Writing for The New York Times, Huw Richards noted Kohli's self-assuredness and "assertiveness" in contrast to some former Indian cricketers who he felt had exhibited an inclination towards excessive politeness and reticence, and that Kohli embodies his combative demeanour both on and off the cricket field.</section>
